				<h1>INTRO</h1>
				<p>
					Given the massive size of AMP-R, we were faced with many mechanical, tedious
					tasks that were highly time-consuming to perform manually. Examples include
					preparing FASTA files from sequences, merging spreadsheets from the DRAMP
					repository, sorting and filtering lists based on certain parameters, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					To save time and effort, we used <strong>Python</strong> to automate these
					tasks. Our simple Python scripts utilized our
					<a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://github.com/KarishmaKaushikLab/AMP-R/blob/master/utils/full.csv"
						>master spreadsheet</a
					>
					containing information about all peptides to achieve this. All of these scripts
					have been made <em>open-source</em> and you can find them on our
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/KarishmaKaushikLab/AMP-R"
						>GitHub repository</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>In this section, we shall talk in detail about these scripts.</p>

				<h1>GENERATION OF FASTA FILES</h1>
				<p>
					Amongst other things, we pulled peptide sequence data from the
					<a target="_blank" href="http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/">DRAMP repository</a>.
					Using these sequence strings, we intended to generate FASTA files. For example,
					for Pep6 with sequence
					<pre>GNGVLKTISHECNMNTWQFLFTCC</pre>
					the corresponding FASTA file would look like
					<pre>>Peptide_6
GNGVLKTISHECNMNTWQFLFTCC</pre>
					This was an obvious and easy target for automation. We simple loop over all the
					peptides in our spreadsheet in order and then generate a FASTA file with their
					sequence. You can find the script for this
					<a
						href="https://github.com/KarishmaKaushikLab/AMP-R/blob/master/utils/fasta.py"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						>here</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to this, we were able to achieve
					<em>what would have taken months within a fraction of a second</em>.

				<h1>FILTERING ANTI-GRAM POSITIVE PEPTIDES</h1>
				<p>
					Our target organism, <em>Corynebacterium striatum</em> exhibits anti-Gram
					positive activity. Thus, we were interested in filtering out peptides which
					exhibited the same activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our master spreadsheet has a column with a list of activities exhibited by each
					peptide. We simply loop over all peptides and look for the
					<strong>Anti-Gram+</strong> activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can find the script for this
					<a
						href="https://github.com/KarishmaKaushikLab/AMP-R/blob/master/scripts/agp_filter/agp_filter.py"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						>here</a
					>. We also have a dedicated section for peptides exhibiting
					<strong>Anti-Gram+</strong> activity
