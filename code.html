				<h1>INTRO</h1>
				<p>
					Given the massive size of AMP-R, we were faced with many mechanical, tedious
					tasks that were highly time-consuming to perform manually. Examples include
					preparing FASTA files from sequences, merging spreadsheets from the DRAMP
					repository, sorting and filtering lists based on certain parameters, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					To save time and effort, we used <strong>Python</strong> to automate these
					tasks. Our simple Python scripts utilized our
					<a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://github.com/KarishmaKaushikLab/AMP-R/blob/master/utils/full.csv"
						>master spreadsheet</a
					>
					containing information about all peptides to achieve this. All of these scripts
					have been made <em>open-source</em> and you can find them on our
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/KarishmaKaushikLab/AMP-R"
						>GitHub repository</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>In this section, we shall talk in detail about these scripts.</p>

				<h1>GENERATION OF FASTA FILES</h1>
				<p>
					Amongst other things, we pulled peptide sequence data from the
					<a target="_blank" href="http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/">DRAMP repository</a>.
					Using these sequence strings, we intended to generate FASTA files. For example,
					for Pep6 with sequence
					<!-- <pre>GNGVLKTISHECNMNTWQFLFTCC</pre>
					the corresponding FASTA file would look like
					<pre>>Peptide_6
GNGVLKTISHECNMNTWQFLFTCC</pre> -->
					This was an obvious and easy target for automation. We simply loop over all the
					peptides in our spreadsheet in order and then generate a FASTA file with their
					sequence. You can find the script for this
					<a
						href="https://github.com/KarishmaKaushikLab/AMP-R/blob/master/utils/fasta.py"

					Thanks to this, we were able to achieve
					<em>what would have taken months within a fraction of a second</em>.

				<h1>FILTERING ANTI-GRAM POSITIVE PEPTIDES</h1>
				<p>
					Our target organism, <em>Corynebacterium striatum</em> exhibits anti-Gram
					positive activity. Thus, we were interested in filtering out peptides which
					exhibited the same activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our master spreadsheet has a column with a list of activities exhibited by each
					peptide. We simply loop over all peptides and look for the
					<strong>Anti-Gram+</strong> activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can find the script for this
					<a
						href="https://github.com/KarishmaKaushikLab/AMP-R/blob/master/scripts/agp_filter/agp_filter.py"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						>here</a
					>. We also have a dedicated section for peptides exhibiting
					<strong>Anti-Gram+</strong> activity
					<a href="/anti_gram_positive.html">here</a>.

				<h1>COMBINING OLD & NEW DRAMP LISTS</h1>
				<p>
					We had pulled a list of peptides from the DRAMP repository back in December 2020
					and were working with it. However, in May 2021 we noticed that DRAMP had revised
					the list with more peptides. Thus, we had to incorporate the new peptides into
					our work.
				</p>
				<p>
					The issue was that we had already assigned Pep IDs as per the order in the
					original list, which were being used throughout our project. Unfortunately,
					DRAMP's revised list did not retain that same order as our original one. Thus,
					we would have to sit down and spend a long time reconciling the changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thankfully, with a bit of data wrangling, we were able to automate this as well. Our Python script first scanned our
					original list to build a mapping between the IDs from the DRAMP database and our
					own Pep IDs. Next, we scanned through the revised list and looked for any
					peptides which weren't part of our original list. Finally, using the mapping we
					built earlier, we retained our original Pep IDs and assigned new ones to the new
					peptides.
